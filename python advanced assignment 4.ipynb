    "1. Plus Operator Overloaded - This involves an extended interpretation of an operator more than its original purpose. The most frequent instance is the adding up operator ‘+’, where it can be used for the usual addition and also for combining two different strings. As mentioned on top, the plus symbol’s practice in dissimilar forms is the largest classic example of the operator level overloading process. Especially the ability of the binary operator to perform the process of concatenation on the pair of the string is especially special.\n",
    "2. Multiplication Operator Overloaded -Another similar example of a binary operator involved in the overloading process can be noticed in the usage of ‘ * ‘. This operator not only responsible for multiplying two given numbers but also has the capability to perform the repetition of strings and lists."

This provides good starting guidance."
